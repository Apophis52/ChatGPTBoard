# ChatGPTBoard
Python script to use ChatGPT on a raspberry pi 400 and emulate a keyboard.


----NOTICE----
I am a novice programmer and am just learning the basics of python and the raspberry pi in general. Expect things not to work, and if there is an issue, I will do what I can but it may not work out, and I am sorry. If you are able to contribute to this project, that would be great, however it was mostly a proof of concept and challenge for myself. This project may never be updated, however only time will tell :)
----NOTICE----




----Installation----

1. install python console and openai as root and normal user.
"pip install console"
"pip install openai"
"sudo pip install console"
"sudo pip install openai"

2. download the python script into the home folder of your pi 400
3. edit the variables inside the script to your liking, and change the openai key to your key (line 93/94)
4. add "sudo python3 GPTBoard.py" to the end of your .bashrc in the home directory
5. profit
